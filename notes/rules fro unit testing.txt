How to proceed with unit tests:
    1. define the shape of the object (make sure it has all of the expected properties and methods)
    2. undefined/empty doesn't cause problems
    3. make sure the happy path works
    4. make sure you have all branches covered
    5. force errors, make sure it can handle them
    6. make sure limits are obeyed
    7. default values assigned
    8. default actions used

General rules:
    validate interactions with other objects (values passed, functions called)
    Do NOT depend on other obects to do work, fake the behavior of other systems

// test a
// test b
// feature c
// behavior d
